# members_info
data collection program for collecting information about our members.

now at ver 0.1 (11/20/2016)
implemented in Python 3, need to download "prog_grp_database.py" to run the program and "member_dat.txt" which contains the current data list

I have implemented this as a simple list of dictionaries.

it could become more complex - implemented with SQL or something else to have true database capabilities.  I'll need some help with that

what I really wanted to do was learn some Pandas framework and I learned enough trying to do this to find that a Pandas framework is not a good format to STORE data, but it can work great to analyze this list for example.
